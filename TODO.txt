- press a button and update mesh VBO
    - initialize the mesh with a VBO of size 0 at start
    - allow the owner of the mesh to update it later (chunk)
    - keep track of the VBO size manually and use glBufferData or glBufferSubData correctly
    - for chunks start off with a large VBO buffer (5MB) so reallocations happen cheaply

- draw a cube from "CUBE" shape

- figure out how to create a camera

- get gamepad input working 

- move camera around by input 

- get a collision setup on the chunk

- when pressing A on the chunk add a new cube to it
